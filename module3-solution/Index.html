        		 		<h2>Chicken</h2>
                    One day Chicken Licken is under a nut tree in the farmyard. A nut falls on her head. She thought the sky is falling. She runs to tell her friends in the farmyard the news. At the end, when they come to know what actually happened, they feel silly and foolish for believing Chicken Licken. Once upon a time, there were a farm. Most of the animals on the farm were happy. But Chicken Licken was not happy. Chicken Licken was a scary cat, afraid of every thing. One day, Chicken Licken went to the forest. He stopped by an oak tree. Suddenly, a small acorn dropped from the tree and hit Chicken Licken’s scalp. Chicken Licken didn’t see the acorn. He looked up at the blue sky. “Oh no! ” he said. “The sky must be falling. Chicken Licken ran around the tree. “The sky is falling! The sky is falling! ” he cried. “I must tell this to the King,” thought Chicken Licken. He hurried back to the farmyard. Henny Penny was sitting by the hen house. “Out of my way! ” screamed Chicken Licken. “What’s the matter? ” asked Henny Penny. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. “Oh no!” said Henny Penny. “What shall we do?” “I’m going to alert the King, ” said Chicken Licken. “I’ll come too,” said Henny Penny. They ran past the hen house and… Thump! They knocked into Cocky Locky. “What’s the matter?” questioned Cocky Locky. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. “Oh no!” said Cocky Locky. “What shall we do?” “We are going to inform the King,” said Henny Penny. “I’ll come too,” said Cocky Locky. They ran out of the farmyard.They ran past the duck pond. Ducky Lucky was swimming. “What’s the matter? ” inquired Ducky Lucky. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. “Oh no!” said Ducky Lucky. “What shall we do?” “We are going to tell the King,” said Cocky Locky. “I’ll come too,” said Ducky Lucky. They ran across the bridge. They came to the old barn. Gosey Loosey was sitting on her nest. “What’s the matter? ” asked Gosey Loosey. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. “Oh no!” said Gosey Loosey. “What shall we do?” “We are going to inform the King,” said Ducky Lucky. “I’ll come too,” said Gosey Loosey. They ran past the barn. They ran into the field. Turkey Lurkey was pecking at the ground. “What’s the matter?” questioned Turkey Lurkey. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. “Oh no!” said Turkey Lurkey. “What shall we do?” “We are going to tell the King, ” said Gosey Loosey. “I’ll come too,” said Turkey Lurkey. They ran through the field. Soon they came to the forest – and Foxy Loxy. “What’s the matter?” asked Foxy Loxy. “The sky is falling!” cried Chicken Licken. Foxy Loxy didn’t believe the sky was falling. But he didn’t say. “We are going to inform the King, ” said Turkey Lurkey. He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well. Who could be following him this late at night and in this deadbeat part of town? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big time and was making off with the greenbacks. Was there another crook who'd had the same idea, and was now watching him and waiting for a chance to grab the fruit of his labour? Or did the steps behind him mean that one of many law officers in town was on to him and just waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his wrists? He nervously looked all around. Suddenly he saw the alley. Like lightning he darted off to the left and disappeared between the two warehouses almost falling over the bin lying in the middle of the pavement. He tried to nervously tap his way along in the inky darkness and suddenly stiffened: it was a dead-end, he would have to go back the way he had come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw the black outline of a figure coming around the corner. Is this the end of the line? he thought pressing himself back against the wall trying to make himself invisible in the dark, was all that planning and energy wasted? He was dripping with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the fear coming off his clothes. Suddenly next to him, with a barely noticeable squeak, a door swung quietly to and fro in the night's breeze. Could this be the haven he'd prayed for? Slowly he slid toward the door, pressing himself more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from his enemy. Would this door save his hide?He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well.
